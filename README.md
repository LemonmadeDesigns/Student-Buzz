Welcome to `Student Buzz`! This is the starting point of a full-stack application that we will be builiding together over the course of our CPSC 361 - Software Engineer class. Each week we will build upon this project, applying the new skills you will be learning along the way. Before we begin, let's cover a few things first:

## Starting Out ##

```yaml
brew services restart mongodb/brew/mongodb-community@4.2
